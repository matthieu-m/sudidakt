A didactic sudoku solver assistant on the command line.

# What is Sudidakt?

Sudidakt intends not to solve sudoku grids, though it can, but instead to _explain_ how to solve grids, on a move by
move basis.

The following usecases are considered:

-   Assisting in solving a grid: if stuck, sudidakt should be able to solve one move.
-   Explaining the moves: sudidakt will be programmed with several ways to either reduce the space of possibilities or
    outright find a set of potential moves, it should be able to explain each and every of them.


# Maturity

Incomplete, immature, just getting started.
